# Andrea-Maglione-STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. This repository contains the replication materials for an analysis of the Philadelphia Eagles offencive performance during the 2016 NFL regular season. The focus of the project is on how average yards per play relates to the total number of first downs achieved per game.

# Data 
This project uses game level data from the Philadelphia Eagles 2016 NFL regular season. The dataset includes one obersevation for each regular season game and provides information on team performance metrics. For the purpose of this analysis, I focus on two key variables: average yards per play and total first downs achieved per game. These variables were selected because they represent core indicators of offensive efficiency and overall game productivity. 

# Operationalization of Variables
-Average Yards per Play: This variable measures the mean number of yards gained by the Eagles for every offensive play in a given game. It is calculated by dividing the team's total offensive yards by the number of offensive plays. In the dataset, this value is already provided as _Yards_per_play_, and no additional transformations were necessary.
-Total First Downs: This variable represents the total number of first downs achieved by the Eagles in each game. It includes first downs gained via rushing, passing, and penalties. In the dataset, this value is provided as _Total_First_Downs_. No recoding or cleaning was required, as all values were already in numeric form and recorded on a per game basis.
